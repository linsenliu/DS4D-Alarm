# DS4D-Alarm
Group assignments for the DS4D course.</b>
In Assignment 2, I used Python to analyse the alarm data from Blackwood. The angle I chose to analyse was the relationship between the characteristics of the person who called the police, the type of alarm and the time of the alarm.</b>
In Assignment 3, we designed a data game using the information we obtained in Assignment 2 and the assumptions we made based on this information. Presented here is the data merging and visualisation work that I did in it.
